I would like to solve the manual work issue that I've seen in my home church. For starters, the conference is dubbed "Believers Dominion Conference" which is held annually and has grown with the past 
9 years. I would like to make the 10th Conference for 2025 to be different by switching to digital registration.

This is a simple web application for registering the congregation. It is an MVP and is set to have more features with time.
The user(in the index.html) adds his details, i.e, name, church where he/she comes from, email and phone number for contact purposes, attending status(daytime/boarder), and role(delegate/host/guest speaker/pastor/any church position).
The system displays an alert box that he/she is successfully registered. If the detals are not fully entered as required, the user is redirected to fill the data again. 

I have applied HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, and PHP/MySQL for the backend and database querying.
